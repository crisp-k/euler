# euler
Solutions to the first 23 Euler problems (and 67th problem).

## Implementation
These solutions are written in Python. The first ~1-9 problems
have additional documentation, explaining my thought process,
approach, and ways to start wokring on the problem.

Included is `commonMethods.py`, which contains functions that
perform actions that are required by many of the solutions in
this repo. It is meant to emphasize the skill of refactoring, 
the DRY principle, as well as pattern recgonition. These are all
worthwhile skills to develop when tackling these problems, and mirrors
the use of common libraries in real-world problems.

Many of the solution files include either failled intial solutions,
rough 'brute-force' solutions, and a more final solution(s) the improves
the run-time of the first successful solution.

## Purpose
This was initially intended to serve as the foundation for a problem solving, 
data structures, and algorithm development lecture series, as these are my
favorite parts from this field. It is an attempt to provide and bring to 
the forefront, multiple different perspectives and approaches when it comes
to handling problems. 

As in mathematics (and life in general), the best way
to learn a specific skill-set is to practice it over-and-over again.
